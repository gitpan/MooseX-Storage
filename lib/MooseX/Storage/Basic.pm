MooseX::Storage::Basic - The simplest level of serialization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Point;
  use Moose;
  use MooseX::Storage;
  
  our $VERSION = '0.01';
  
  with Storage;
  
  has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
  has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
  
  1;
  
  my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);
  
  ## methods to pack/unpack an 
  ## object in perl data structures
  
  # pack the class into a hash
  $p->pack(); # { __CLASS__ => 'Point-0.01', x => 10, y => 10 }
  
  # unpack the hash into a class
  my $p2 = Point->unpack({ __CLASS__ => 'Point-0.01', x => 10, y => 10 });
