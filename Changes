Revision history for MooseX-Storage

0.08
    * MooseX::Storage::Format::JSON
      - added support to deal with utf8 strings correctly

0.07 Thurs. Sept. 27, 2007
    + MooseX::Storage::Format::Storable
      - this will use Storable to freeze/thaw objects
        - added tests for this
    
    + MooseX::Storage::IO::StorableFile
      - this will use Storable to load/store objects    
        - added tests for this

    * t/
      - fixed tests in 030_with_checksum.t
        (thanks to sartak)

0.06 Tues. Aug. 7, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - added the Bool type and fixed a few bugs
        that it exposed (thanks to Sartak)
        - added tests for this

0.05 Sun. July 15. 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Base::WithChecksum
      - Fixed minor issue where the WithChecksum would 
        choke with a bad checksum due to odd Data::Dumper
        output.
    
    * t/
      - forced JSON::Any in the basic JSON tests to use 
        JSON.pm since this is what Test::JSON uses and 
        subtle (and annoying) issues can arise.

0.04 Tues. July 3, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Util
        - made this more robust when it tries
          to use YAML and JSON loaders and fails
          to find one
            - fixed tests to reflect this

0.03 Wed. June 27, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Util
        - this is a collection of useful tools 
          for working with MooseX::Storage data
            - added docs and test

    * t/
        - added test for a custom type handler
        - fixed checksum test to skip if Digest::SHA1 
          (our default) is not available

0.02 Fri. June 8, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Base::WithChecksum
      - added a simple base role which makes a checksum of 
        the data structure before packing, and checks the
        checksum before unpacking.
        - added tests for this

    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - better error reporting when cycles are found
      - class names are now stored as the full identifier
        (<class>-<version>-<authority>) and are checked
        when they are expanded.
        - added docs and tests for this

    * MooseX::Storage::Engine::IO::(AtomicFile, File)
      - added checks to make sure the file gets opened correctly
        and dies if it does not.

0.01  Mon. April 30, 2007
    This was Chris's idea originally (blame him), and 
    we expanded on it to create what you see here :)
